Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning classification task using the famous Iris flower dataset. The objective is to train a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.
Project Structure

    app_01.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing all the Python code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

    IRIS.csv: The dataset used for this project.

Key Libraries

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

    scikit-learn: A robust machine learning library for model training and evaluation.

    matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization (though not fully utilized in the provided notebook, these are common for data science projects).

    numpy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

How to Run the Code

To run the code, you will need a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed.

    Clone the repository:

    git clone <your-repository-url>

    Navigate to the project directory:

    cd iris-flower-classification

    Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    Install the required packages:

    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

    Note: The older sklearn package is deprecated. Always use scikit-learn for installation.

    Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    Launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal and open the app_01.ipynb file.

    jupyter notebook
